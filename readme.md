# Mouse offset
learning how to write offset stuff, more focus on repetition

# TIL

* Today before he got started with what needed to be done, I was able to write some things out... I didn't get 100% right, but I got close.  This is better than being compeletely lost
* more use of LET and I kinda got it, sorta.  I know LET is dynamic where CONST stays the same
* more use of the es6 syntax... I think I could write some things, just not everything
* lots of math that hurt my head, but I kinda got the offets ok enough
